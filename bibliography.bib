@article{cruwell2019,
	abstract = {Few scientific developments are as divisive as the increasingly popular Open Science movement. Because exact definitions are lacking and reforms are constantly evolving, accessible guides to Open Science are needed. This paper provides an introduction to Open Science and related reforms in the form of an annotated reading list of 8 peer-reviewed articles, following the format of Etz et al. (2018). Written for researchers and students particularly in psychological science - it highlights eight topics: understanding open science; open access; open data, materials, and code; reproducible analyses; preregistration and registered reports; best practices in statistics and methodology; replication research; and teaching open science. For each topic, we provide a detailed summary of one particularly informative and actionable article and suggest several further resources. Supporting a broader understanding of Open Science issues, this overview should enable researchers to engage with, improve, and implement current open, transparent, reproducible, replicable, and cumulative scientific practices.},
