## Additional information

During the workshop, a discussion took place in the audience in which we discussed the possibilities for EU researchers to share pre-prints and post-prints. During this discussion, a reference was made to an excel file with an overview to the legislation in each EU country with regards to sharing manuscripts: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1T1ki63e37NEUETL4jF6xPLBucBUoqjgTCfXIyJBdsM0/htmlview#
